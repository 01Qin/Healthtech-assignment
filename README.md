Hardware Assembly</br>
To get Raspberry Pi Pico and Pulse Sensor up and running, follow these steps:</br>
1.	Connect the sensor's wires properly: The red wire goes to the 3.3V power pin, the black wire to ground (GND), and the yellow wire to the signal pin on the Raspberry Pi Pico.</br>
2.	Secure the setup: Place the Raspberry Pi Pico on a breadboard to keep the connections stable and organized.</br>
3.	Establish the power source: Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico to computer via a USB cable. This will provide both power and allow data transfer.</br>

●	Powering On: Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico to the USB cable, which will automatically power on the device and start the pulse monitoring script.</br>
●	Place the finger on the sensor: Allow the optical detector to pick up your pulse.</br>
●	Monitor the data: Watch the OLED display for continuous updates.</br>
●	Powering Off: Disconnect the USB cable to turn off the device.</br>
●	Ensure stability: Place the device on a steady surface to avoid external interference.</br>

3	Using the Device</br>

Your pulse and heart rate are two different ways to track your heart’s activity. Your heart rate is how many times your heart beats per minute. Your pulse rate is how many times per minute your arteries expand because of your heart beating. There’s usually no difference between your heart rate and your pulse rate (or the difference is very small). </br>

3.1	How does Heartie work</br>

Optical (photoplethysmography): Heartie uses infrared light to see the expansion of your arteries as your heart pumps blood through them. Heartie tracks your pulse rate, and some can also estimate the oxygen levels in your blood. It also measures and displays other metrics, like heart rate variability.</br>

3.2	How to Interpret the Results</br>
Heartie displays your heart rate in beats per minute (BPM).</br>
●	Normal Resting Heart Rate: A normal resting heart rate for adults typically ranges from 50 - 70 BPM.</br>

<img width="376" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ce5cd1a-8290-4649-909d-5cf73dbb041c" /></br>

 
 
●	Heart Rate Zones: Heartie displays different heart rate zones: recovery/easy, aerobic/base, tempo, lactate threshold, anaerobic. Each zone indicates a different level of intensity.</br>

<img width="444" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff90801d-8e47-46b7-850c-9c74bdb00a3f" /></br>

 
●	Abnormal Readings: If you consistently observe readings outside the normal range, or experience any discomfort, consult your doctor.</br>

  Additional Tips:</br>
●	Cleaning: Clean the device regularly with a soft cloth. </br>
●	Accuracy: The accuracy of the readings may vary depending on factors such as skin contact, body position, and movement.</br>
●	Storage: Store the device in a cool, dry place.</br>

  Safety Precautions</br>
●	Do not use the device while operating machinery or driving.</br>
●	Do not immerse the device in water.</br>
●	Avoid direct sunlight on the sensor. This can interfere with the readings</br>
●	Use in a stable environment. Avoid excessive hand movement for accurate readings.</br>
●	This device is not a medical device and should not be used to diagnose or treat medical conditions. Consult a healthcare professional for any health concerns.</br>

4	Troubleshooting</br>

1.	Inconsistent Readings: Keep your finger still on the sensor and ensure proper positioning.</br>
2.	No power or data transfer: Verify that the USB cable is properly connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico and the computer. Check for any loose wiring on the breadboard.</br>
3.	Signal pin issues: Ensure the yellow signal wire is correctly connected to the designated pin on the Raspberry Pi Pico.</br>
